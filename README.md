# Premise:
### Sometimes, when you aren't using the screen, making it bright is useful.

# What does this do? (functions)
it does 1.1 things:


0.1 things:  The whole screen is one color

## 1 thing: you can click on different parts of the screen to change the color:

left/right adjusts color temperature, with white in the middle.

up/down adjusts brightness

# Why does this exist?
It's called lightbulb because that's what it's supposed to be used for. 

So, why did I need a monitor to do that?

I needed to do schoolwork somewhere, and a desk was just the right place. 

My desk, however, was, at the time, in part a of my weirdly shaped room, where ceiling light didn't quite reach.

This is a problem because, unlike what most github users think, light is actually a good thing, which you need sometimes.

My computer was (is) on this desk, and i often found the monitor's light to be a bit stronger.

So, I often found myself searching the web for images of the colors white or beige, and putting one on full screen for the light.

It was a little tedious to do this every time, so I decided to make an ""interface"" that was a little more deserving of a bookmark.

I came up with this, because desk lamps cost more than free, but github.io is free.

Now, my problem is fixed! Because I am writing this much after I made this. As of now, my desk is moved anyway, and I am ironically writing this in the dark.

Even though that's fixed, I still find this useful for cleaning my laptop.
